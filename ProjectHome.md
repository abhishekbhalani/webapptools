**WebAppTools** - the complex of programs and the knowledge base for the vulnerability analysis of the implementations and customizations of web-applications and web-servers.

The given complex is intended for inventory and an security estimation of various (heterogeneous) web-applications. The project is developed with usage of [WebEngine kernel](WebEngine.md).

Authors of the **WebAppTools** project are employees the [Positive Technologies Research Lab](http://ptresearch.blogspot.com/). [Positive Technologies](http://www.ptsecurity.ru/) - one of the leading companies in information security in Russia. The principle company's activities are: information security monitoring systems development (XSpider, MaxPatrol); consulting and services in IT security, Securitylab special portal development.

The project is being developed [WebEngine kernel](WebEngine.md) and different software systems and tools based on it. The main characteristics of the kernel:

  * Modular structure, which allows one to implement plug-ins;
  * Obtaining information through various transport mechanisms (mainly HTTP);
  * Support for various authentication mechanisms and schemes;
  * Using JavaScript in the processing and analysis;
  * A wide variety of options to describe the scan target.

On the basis of the [WebEngine kernel](WebEngine.md) the following utilities are implemented

  * **[Crawler](CrawlerDemo.md)** - demo application for evaluation and debugging of **WebEngine**.
  * **MsPatchCheck** - program for monitoring changes in Microsoft's security bulletins (Positive Technologies property).
  * **DataExtractor** - utility for gathering relevant information from various sources. (private property)

The main target audience for the **WebAppTools** system is the information security experts, system administrators, hosting-providers and the web-application developers.

<a href='Hidden comment: The service for deployment and customization for Customer needs, and the technical support on a paid basis is offered to hosting-providers and other interested.'></a> The project is opened for developers under condition of saving the "an open source" spirit.
